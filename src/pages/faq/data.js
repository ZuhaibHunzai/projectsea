    <p class="py-2">All updates will be made through the official PROJECT SEA Twitter and Discord.</p>
    <p class="py-2">To protect yourself in the crypto and NFT space, we recommend using a cold wallet such as a Ledger to store your assets. This is the minimum step you can take to safeguard your crypto assets.</p>
    <p class="py-2">Be aware that many attacks on crypto users come in the form of social manipulation. We will never contact you directly or act as a middle-man in a trade. If an opportunity seems too good to be true or requires urgent action, it's probably a scam. Be cautious and protect yourself.</p>
    <p class="py-2">We will never ask you to connect your wallet or send us any of your NFTs without prior notice. There will be no "surprise mint" or sudden instances where we ask for such actions.</p>
